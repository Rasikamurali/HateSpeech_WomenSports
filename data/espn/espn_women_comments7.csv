Secondly talent has never been a major parameter in determining who the best player in the World is, otherwise Jordan would have been clearly better than Magic Johnson from 87-90, but that was not the case. Also, a larger sample size makes the data more reliable, a Finals MVP has never meant that one is the best in the World, it is only 4-7 games compared to a 100-game full season sample. \n\nWith KD the Dubs were 29-24, no Curry. Flip it and it is 36-14, 4 of those losses in the Finals. In fact the last two seasons, Curry missed significant time and the Dubs never won over 60 games. Durant missed time in 2017 and the Warriors won 67 games. \nThe greatest judgement of skillset is how it translates in not only making you look good but how it makes your teammates better, Curry wins that also as the impact metrics had shown. The best isolation play for the Warriors was a Steph Curry shot in those years, which was one of the reasons teams chose to gameplan more for him. Steph outranked KD 2 out of 3 times in the MVP voting and the only time he did not, he only played 51 games all season. In the whole playoffs Curry again outplayed him. What the 2019 Finals showed was that as great as Steph is, like any great player he is not great enough to drag an injury riddled team to a victory, no one is. Secondly  the series was still close, i.e one shot or run or a Klay could have changed our whole outlook. \n\nThe only argument for KD was his stats, but we all know again that the major improvements in his statistics especially the playoff statistics was again, Stephen Curry. \n\nWhat the following years 2020-23 did was be consistent with what was true in those 3 years, not only was Curry the best player for the Warriors, but he was arguably the best player of the last 10 years, the only competition he had was Giannis, Jokic, Kawhi and LeBron.\n\nLike Kobe and Shaq between 99-04, as talented and skillful individually as Kobe was, his impact on the Lakers was never on the level of a Shaquille O' Neal, therefore he was never a better player than Shaq."", 'GSW DID bounce back in 2022 with no KD', 'I agree that the 90s were tougher but they make it seem like dudes were bench pressing on the sidelines and dudes were getting stretchered off the courts after driving into the lane üòÇüòÇüòÇ', ""Kendrick Perkins is terrible he's A LeBron fanboy"", ""Kendrick Perkins proved that he's a idiot"", 'What is every nba players ultimate  goal when getting into the nba is it too win a nba championship. I mean they can be mvp, rookie of the year, nba all star, defensive player, scoring champion and goal medal winner in the Olympics  which are great accomplishments but being an nba champion  is what few players have chance to be. Which is the ultimate  goal for every great players just like the stanley cup, grey cup world series, and superbowl.', ""I know I'm late but KD wasn't going back to the Warriors after what Bob Myers said and Draymond calling him a b**ch.

His mouth was the reason Warriors lost to the Cavs in 2016 in the first place"", 'People get misunderstanding better with more talented', 'That okc team was loaded', 'Perkins is such a fuckin clown.

Especially when all he does is shoot and play defense.', 'Russell Westbrick lol, more like Russell Worstbrick..', ""14:33 CoJ, you're on point most of the time, but you consistently miss the point with KD and GSW. GSW can and HAVE won without KD. This year's finals didn't prove that they need KD to win. Before Klay went down in game 6 I have no reason to believe they wouldn't have continued to ride his momentum and complete their comeback to force a game 6. In a game 7, I'm taking GSW over TOR. They can win a chip without KD. They can't win a chip without KD AND Klay. Get it? KD would have NEVER been respected for the rings he attained with Golden State, never."", ""Well what other small man has won back to back MVPs, with one being unanimous?  I think it's fair to expect more from Steph."", 'How they gonna sign kd?', ""Percalater was never a factor in any finals but u say curry dont rise to the occasion what about your friend beard dr jeckle mr hyde but let him tell it steph is just handed stuff he's the golden boy new york lingo foh""]"

Doug let Jordan do what he wanted and there was great chemistry between the two. Jordan grew to appreciate Phil Jackson and Scotti Pipen may of had something to do with this due to his ability to mesh with Jordan well and be the one who smoother things out with the players who would get upset with Jordan, chewed out by Jordan, or were scared to approach Jordan after practice, pipen was the go to.

Problem was, Sam Bowie became Walton 2.0 as far as the injuries go"", 'When lebron retires he will be forgotten..when Jordan dies he will leave in our memories and generations to come till the day planet earth is extinct.', ""That college team going 9-0 against NBA teams back then is a testament to how garbage the league was back then.  A college team WOULDN'T go 1-8 against any pro team today. Michael dominated a watered down league in the 90s , while magic and bird dominated a coke head league in the 80s , that's why I laugh everytime i hear someone say Larry Bird is greater than Lebron James.

People who saw Jordan then, he didn't have a perimeter game; he developed his game like in 1989-90 and became great from mid to long range. Pippen didn't have a perimeter game either until like 1991. \n\nConcerning Isiah Thomas vs. Jordan - that was a great rivalry and I wish there was no jealousy yet a great rivalry where the Pistons made the right moves personnel-wise after 1991 or that Thomas stayed out with the wrist injury - a lot of changes could have been made to prolong those great match ups into the 90's. \n\nDoug Collins could hold his own yet always made a team better to repair a crappy team...
