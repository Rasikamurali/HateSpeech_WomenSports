104,"""One thing we need to do is be consistent"
105,something the media has never done with Curry as they always go to extremes when judging his play. Secondly talent has never been a major parameter in determining who the best player in the World is
106,otherwise Jordan would have been clearly better than Magic Johnson from 87-90
107,but that was not the case. Also
108,a larger sample size makes the data more reliable
109,a Finals MVP has never meant that one is the best in the World
110,it is only 4-7 games compared to a 100-game full season sample. \n\nWith KD the Dubs were 29-24
111,no Curry. Flip it and it is 36-14
112,4 of those losses in the Finals. In fact the last two seasons
113,Curry missed significant time and the Dubs never won over 60 games. Durant missed time in 2017 and the Warriors won 67 games. \nThe greatest judgement of skillset is how it translates in not only making you look good but how it makes your teammates better
114,Curry wins that also as the impact metrics had shown. The best isolation play for the Warriors was a Steph Curry shot in those years
115,which was one of the reasons teams chose to gameplan more for him. Steph outranked KD 2 out of 3 times in the MVP voting and the only time he did not
116,he only played 51 games all season. In the whole playoffs Curry again outplayed him. What the 2019 Finals showed was that as great as Steph is
117,like any great player he is not great enough to drag an injury riddled team to a victory
118,no one is. Secondly  the series was still close
119,i.e one shot or run or a Klay could have changed our whole outlook. \n\nThe only argument for KD was his stats
120,but we all know again that the major improvements in his statistics especially the playoff statistics was again
121,Stephen Curry. \n\nWhat the following years 2020-23 did was be consistent with what was true in those 3 years
122,not only was Curry the best player for the Warriors
123,but he was arguably the best player of the last 10 years
124,the only competition he had was Giannis
125,Jokic
126,Kawhi and LeBron.\n\nLike Kobe and Shaq between 99-04
