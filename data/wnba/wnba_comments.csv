17,"""Wrong move from mgmnt 2 fire VJ.  They should've given her 2 more seasons for the team 2 grow.  Arike injury played a major part in there loss 2 the Sun's.  That's was Dallas series 2 win but they had no 1 effectively ready 2 step up in place of Arike.  McCowan isn't in physical condition 2 play more minutes.  At times she plays lazy"
18,"just as she did in college.  She can really b a beast if she get in better physical condition."""
19,'Marina RFA and hopefully signs elsewhere or guaranteed the point guard spot....Arike has to become a better team player or that Dallas franchise is doomed thru the life of that contract... 7 for 23 from the field on nights she is off occur way to often.She a 6th player off the bench and no coach there has put her there...Colier was overrated in College and simply a horrible pick in that draft....Next coach needs Sabally healthy and McCowan starting every game with more endurance from her part w/a demand to improve the FT %....5 years of watching this team mishandle management and coaching ..Tighten Up!']

56,"[""Ayoka Lee should transfer. She is too talented to not be able to compete for a National Championship"
57,and there are several schools that would instantly become a title threat with her. She's very underrated even though she dropped 50 a couple years ago. There are 10-15 teams where they're decent teams but Ayoka Lee would make them a serious threat. Iowa will be good
58,but if you add Ayoka Lee to Iowa... all of a sudden Caitlin Clark doesn't have to score 40 pts because Ayoka Lee will give you 15-20 pts a night
59,easy. There isn't a team that doesn't have room for Ayoka Lee. Sometimes the big girls are not ranked high enough but if Ayoka Lee transferred
60,"she'd be right up at the top. She's an old school center and there just aren't many of those around."""
