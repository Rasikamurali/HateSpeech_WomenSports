19,6_7uSPzlhJU,Yale's Lilah Grubman plays point guard ‚Äî and the tuba | Women's basketball podcast,"Host Howard Megdal caught up with Lilah Grubman, the renaissance woman entering her freshman year at Yale. Though a knee injury is keeping her out of action in 2022-23, Grubman is someone to pay attention to. Hear how she does everything from navigating the expectations that come with being a prominent point guard from Syosset, like Sue Bird, to her incredible musical facility. Even her role as a Jewish figure in sports is discussed. Grubman is a fascinating figure entering the women's college basketball scene, and you're going to want to hear what she has to say.
